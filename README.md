This is a educational project created as the simple and efficient aiogram 3.x bot template. This template includes some of the pre-built objects that will increase start-up time as well. If you want to create a real, production-ready telegram bots in aiogram, please don't use this template as a start-up template, as I have noticed many unnecessary and over-engineered things here later. You can check out this and see this if you are interested anyways.
